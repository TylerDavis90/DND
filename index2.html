            But before i get to ahead of myself lets talk about how Earth ended up this way and the setting of this world as it is now. 
            The year is around the year 3521 ad. 
            This world is rule by these dragons and one of these dragons are very hard on his section of the usa. 
            Wyatt just so happens to live in this area and thats where alot of hell is

            Wyatt grew up in north Gorgia in the heart of red dragon territory. He grew up in a family that has always resisted the power of the red dragon army.
            Wyatt is now 135 years old. He has lost wife and kids to raids done by the red dragon. Now at his young age( young for a dwarf) he and one of his old friends
            join forces to finally take down the red dragon.
